I Added a function called  getLiveVotes() in smart contract
I compiled the file and got a new json file 
I added it to frontend source as vote.json
I modified the compenent to import voteContract from '../vote.json';
I updated votingInterface with Real-Time Graph (Text-Based)
I didnâ€™t integrate const proof = []; 
const leaf = '0x...';  that yet
